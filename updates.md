###### November 12th, 2024  

I participated in the **QUB Datathon**, hosted in partnership with **Alteryx SparkED** and sponsored by **Kainos**, at **Queenâ€™s Business School**. During the event, I received training in **Alteryx**, learning how to leverage data analytics tools for handling **Big Data**. Working as part of a team, we analyzed datasets on *deprivation in Northern Ireland*. We presented *impact of hunger and education on deprivation* in the region.
